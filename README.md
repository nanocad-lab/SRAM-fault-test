SRAM-fault-test
===============

Code for an mbed microcontroller that runs march SS tests on embedded SRAM on a test chip through the JTAG interface. The custom test chip is for VarExp board version Orange Ferrari.

It is suggested that you build the sources (*.cpp, *.h) using the mbed online compiler, targetting the LPC1768. The Makefile is not guaranteed to be compatible with your version of gcc nor is the provided mbed library guaranteed to be the latest version.
